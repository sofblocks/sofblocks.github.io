Computers uses several number system to represent and work with numbers.The most popular ones are binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal.

## Binary

Its made up of only 0's and 1's. This represent on and off state which is the only language a computer can understand as it is the easiest way to vary instructions through electric signals.

A Byte [01001010] is  equivalence of  8bits          
ASCII which stands for American Starndard code for information insterchange ----> Uses 7 bits


Binary Number == Base 2 | There is 2 possible values 0 and 1

Octal No == Base 8 | 8 digits | 0-7
Decimal No == Base 10 | There are 10 digits | 0-9 | 

Hexadecimal No == Base 16 | There 16 digits | 0-9 ABCDEF |

Hexadecimal:      [	0  1 2  3  4  5 6 7	8	9	A	B	C	D	E	F     ]         
Decimal:	    [	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12	13	14	15 ]
 
1 bit                  Bit              
4 bits                 Nibble                
8 bits                 Byte             
16 bits/2bytes         Word             
32 bits/4bytes         Long word            
64 bits/8bytes         Very Log word            

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a code for representing 128 English characters as numbers, with each letter assigned a number from 0 to 127.

## Base64 Encoding

When you have some binary data that you want to ship across a network, you generally don't do it by just streaming the bits and bytes over the wire in a raw format. Why? because some media are made for streaming text. You never know -- some protocols may interpret your binary data as control characters (like a modem), or your binary data could be screwed up because the underlying protocol might think that you've entered a special character combination (like how FTP translates line endings).

To get around this the binary data needs to be encoded to characters. Base64 works by taking 3 bytes  from a string and returning 4bytes

Take the word "Hey".
The Ascii representation of each letter in the above word will be:      
 72 [H]             
 101 [e]            
 121 [y]            

The binary representation of the Ascii decimals will be:    
 72 [H]   [01001000]                
 101 [e]  [01100101]            
 121 [y]   [01111001]


Base64 works by taking 3 bytes from a byte stream and return 4 bytes each made up of 6 bits.


[H]      | | | || |        [e]      | | | | |     [y]     
[72]      | | | |||        [101]    | | | ||      [121]    ||||||| < - - - - Decimal representation

[01001000]   | | |    [01100101]   | | |   [01111001] ||||||  < - - - - 8bit representation

[010010]      | || |      [000110]    | | | |  [010101]   | | |   [111001] | < - - - - Regrouped to 6 bits - group
[18]          | || |      [6]      | | | |    [21]      | | |  [57] | < - - - - Decimal representation
[S]      | || |          [G]      | | | |    [V]      | | |  [5]  | < - - - - Base64


Each of the newly formed digit is converted to a single character in the Base64 alphabet table made up of 65-character subset of the ASCII charset.
The first 64 characters out of the 65-character subset are mapped to an equivalent 6-bit binary sequence. The extra 65th character (=) is used for padding.

When the input has fewer than 24 bits at the end, zero bits are added (on the right) to form an integral number of 6-bit groups. Then, one or two pad (=) characters are output depending on the following cases.

* The last chunk of input contains exactly 8 bits: Four zero bits are added to form two 6-bit groups. Each 6-bit group is converted to the resulting Base64 encoded character using the Base64 index table. After that two pad (=) characters are appended to the output.

* The last chunk of input contains exactly 16 bits: Two zero bits are added to form three 6-bit groups. Each of the three 6-bit groups is converted to the corresponding Base64 alphabet. Finally a single pad (=) character is appended to the output.

2^6 = 64  

Python Code:  For an input made up of exactly 3 bytes.
```python
>>> import base64
>>> message = b"Hey"
>>> base64.b64encode(message)
b'SGV5'
```
Python Code: For an input made up of 4 bytes.
```python 
>>> import base64
>>> message = b"Hey."     // adde a period at the end of the word Hey.
>>> base64.b64encode(message)
b'SGV5Lg=='     // Outputs with double pad (==)
```

Python Code: For an input made up of 5 bytes (16 bits).
```python 
>>> import base64
>>> message = b"Heys."
>>> base64.b64encode(message)
b'SGV5cy4='    // Appends single pad(=)

```

## Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal is a convenient way to express binary numbers in modern computers in which a byte is almost always defined as containing eight binary digits. When showing the contents of computer storage (for example, when getting a core dump of storage in order to debug a new computer program or when expressing a string of text characters or a string of binary values in coding a program or HTML page), one hexadecimal digit can represent the arrangement of four binary digits. Two hexadecimal digits can represent eight binary digits, or a byte.

41 is the Hexadicimal value of 65,  Also written as 0x41. The prefix 0x  is a notation for Hexa as 0b is for Binary.

Binascii converts binary data to hex
```python 
>>> import binascii
>>> x = b'A'
>>> binascii.hexlify(x)
b'41'
>>> _.decode()
'41'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> x = "Cyber Security".encode()
>>> binascii.hexlify(x)
b'4379626572205365637572697479'
>>> _.decode()
'4379626572205365637572697479'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decimal conversion:
>>> hex(65)
'0x41'
>>> _[2:]
'41'
>>> 

```
Converting hex values to ASCII text
```python
>>> import binascii
>>> binascii.unhexlify('41').decode()
'A'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> x = "Cyber Security".encode()
>>> binascii.hexlify(x).decode()
'4379626572205365637572697479'
>>> bytes.fromhex(_)
b'Cyber Security'
>>> _.decode()
'Cyber Security'
```
Converting hex to decimal.
```python
>>> int('41', 16)
65
```
Convertion using command line tool:

```python
ulab@ulab-ws:~$ echo "Hallo" | xxd -ps
48616c6c6f0a
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ulab@ulab-ws:~$ printf "48616c6c6f0a" | xxd -r -p
Hallo

```
Decimal to binary:
```python
>>> x = 65
>>> bin(x)
'0b1000001'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reverse:
>>> x = bin(65)[2:]
>>> x
'1000001'
>>> int(x, 2)
65
```
