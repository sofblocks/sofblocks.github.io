The following are a few takeaway points from the Beep box.

## Image Enumeration

```python
Download the image file from online.
curl -k http://url -o image.png | k ---> ignore certificae checking

exiftool image.png
```

## Linux-PAM

Pluggable Authentication Modules evolved from the Unix-PAM architecture is a powerful suite of shared libraries used to dynamically authenticate a user to applications (or services) in a Linux system.

/etc/pam.d/passwords-auth
/etc/pam.d/system-auth

## /proc/self/ 

The /proc/self/ directory is a link to the currently running process. In other words it represents the process that's reading /proc/self/.

```python
If you do ls -l /proc/self
you'll see ls's pid

/proc/self/status -> get curent user id and group id
```

## SSH Files

- .ssh/authorized_keys – Holds the `signature` of the public key of any authorised clients.
- .ssh/id_rsa – Holds the private key for the client.
- .ssh/id_rsa.pub – Holds the public key for the client.
- .ssh/known_hosts – Holds a list of host signatures of hosts that the client has previously connected to.

A couple of caveats:

* This is for OpenSSH, commercial SSH uses different file names and formats.
* id_rsa covers keypairs generate using the RSA algorithm. If DSA is used the filename is id_dsa

Assuming an attacker has managed to compromise an account and got access to the above ssh files. A simple way to launch a horizontal attack is by getting a list of servers that the machine has connected to before. The list can be obtained from the `.known_hosts` file.

Once the attacker has the list he can connect to the servers assumming the servers are up and passwordless ssh key connection is setup in the `.known_host file`.

*Administrators need to understand the risks of using ssh keys.*

## Gobuster -k flag

I encountered a problem when I was trying to perform directory bursting using the famous tool gobuster.
This had to do with ssl certificate verification.

To solve this simply add the -k flag in the command which is meant to skip certificate verification.

```python
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u https://10.10.10.7/ -k
```

## Enumerating PBX:

Tools: svmap and svwar

```python
 svmap 10.10.10.7
 svwar -m INVITE -e200-600 10.10.10.7   --->  Identifies working extension lines on a PBX
```
## Linux File descriptors:

These are integer numbers that uniquely represents an opened file in operating system.

|Standard|  |In	|   |stdin| 0
|Standard|  |Out|	|stdout|1
|Standard|  |Error|	|stderr|2

```python
1>filename   # Redirect stdout to file "filename."  
2>filename   # Redirect stderr to file "filename."  
&>filename   # Redirect both stdout and stderr to file "filename." # This operator is now functional, as of Bash 4, final release.  

M>N
     # "M" is a file descriptor, which defaults to 1, if not explicitly set.
     # "N" is a filename.
     # File descriptor "M" is redirect to file "N."
2>&1
      # Redirects stderr to stdout.
      # Error messages get sent to same place as standard output.
        >>filename 2>&1
            bad_command >>filename 2>&1
            # Appends both stdout and stderr to the file "filename" ...
        2>&1 | [command(s)]
            bad_command 2>&1 | awk '{print $5}'   # found
            # Sends stderr through a pipe.
            # |& was added to Bash 4 as an abbreviation for 2>&1 |.

```

Opening the file descriptors for reading and writing:

```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    FILENAME="/tmp/out.txt"
    # Opening file descriptors # 3 for reading and writing
    # i.e. /tmp/out.txt
    exec 3<>$FILENAME

    # Write to file
    echo "Today is $(date)" >&3
    echo "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. " >&3
    echo "Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering." >&3
    echo "--- Yoda" >&3

    # close fd # 3
    exec 3>&-
```
