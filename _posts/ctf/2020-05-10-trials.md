## PsExec

Main purpose of this utility was to help Windows administrators perform important tasks such as executing commands on remote systems.

The PsExec utility requires a few things on the remote system: 
- The Server Message Block (SMB) service which runs on port 139 / 445, must be available and reachable (i.e. not blocked by firewall).
- File and Print Sharing must be enabled.
- The `Admin$` share must be available and accessible. It is a hidden SMB share that maps to the Windows directory intended for software deployments (C:\Windows\System32\).
- The credentials supplied to the PSExec utility must have permissions to access the `Admin$` share.

## How it works:

PSExec has a Windows Service image inside of its executable. It takes this service and deploys it to the Admin$ share on the remote machine. It then uses the DCE/RPC interface over SMB to access the Windows Service Control Manager API. It turns on the PSExec service on the remote machine. The PSExec service then creates a named pipe that can be used to send commands to the system.
