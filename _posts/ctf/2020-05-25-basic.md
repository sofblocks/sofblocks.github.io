I was able to complete a challenge posted on Try Hackme Website and below are a few takeaways from it.

## SSH Bruteforcing

If you managed to grab a list of users or even one user you can use hydra to brute force your way into the system.

```python
hydra -l username -P passwordlist ssh://ip
```
## Using ssh2john

I was able to grab ssh private key of a another user from a different user's account, but in order to ssh using that private key I was asked to provide a pass phrase.

```python
ssh2john.py id_rsa > forjohn.txt (Hash file that john the ripper can understand)
```
Afterwards pass the file to john:
```python
john forjohn.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
```
