The following are some useful information I was able to learn from tackling the above HTB box.

## DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) is like an Internet phonebook. It is responsible for resolving human-readable hostnames into machine-readable IP addresses. 
DNS servers host zones. A DNS zone is a portion of the domain name space that is served by a DNS server. For example, something.com with all its subdomains may be a zone. However, second.something.com may also be a separate zone.

## DNS Enumeration:

### Nslookup tool:

```python

    root@kali:~# nslookup google.com
    Server:		8.8.8.8
    Address:	8.8.8.8#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:	google.com
    Address: 216.58.223.110
    Name:	google.com
    Address: 2a00:1450:401a:805::200e

```


### Host tool
```python

```
### Dig tool

```python

```

using gobuster:
```python
root@kali# gobuster dns -d cronos.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt 
```
### Dns Zone transfer 

```python
    root@kali# dig axfr cronos.htb @10.10.10.13
```

## Sqlmap tool

```python
    sqlmap -v 4 -r login.txt
```
### env command:

Provide information about the shell enviroment your working with.
```python

```
Using shared memory:
 /dev/shm 


### Bitbucket

```python

/del/null   ---> Also called bit bucket | if you send output to /dev/null it simply disappears.
find -name filename 2> /dev/null   | The command directs the stderr to the bit bucket.

cat /dev/null filename    | empties the contents of the file.

```
