This is like a personal notebook containing a collection of stuff related to IT security specifically Penetration Testing.
These are things I come accross on my day-to-day cyber security learning journey.Stuff that I can refer to incase I don't remember, I hope you find something useful.

A rose smells better than a cabbage, but that doesn\'t mean it can make a better stew. 
Don't try to compare yourself too much to others. `You also have your own strength search it and build on it`.
You may make better stew than they think.
If God could wait long enough for snails to enter Noah's ark, His door of grace won't close till you reach your expected position in life. Never look down on yourself.
