A rose smells better than a cabbage, but that doesn't mean it can make a better stew. 
Don't try to compare yourself too much to others. `You also have your own strength search it and build on it`.
You may make better stew than they think.


If God could wait long enough for snails to enter Noah's ark, His door of grace won't close till you reach your expected position in life. Never look down on yourself keep looking up.
