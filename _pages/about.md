Simple rules to live by.
```yml
--> Don't compare yourself to others. Everyone has their own strength such for yours and build on it. 
--> Never look down upon yourself, If God could wait long enough for snails to enter Noah's ark, His door of grace won't close untill you reach your expected position in life.

```
