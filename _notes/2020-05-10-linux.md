# Linux Stuff

## MD5 Checksum

An MD5 checksum is a very reliable way to verify data integrity. The MD5 algorithm takes a file of arbitrary length and produces a 128-bit fingerprint of characters and numbers from that file. It is proposed that it is computationally infeasible to produce two messages having the same output of numbers and characters.

It works with file contents and not the file name.
Other checksum algorithm methods used to verify data integrity are
-   sha1sum
-   sha256sum

## TCPDUMP

TCPDump allows you to filter network traffic for useful information

```yml
    - See the list of interfaces on which tcpdump can listen:
      tcpdump -D
    - Listen on interface eth0:
      tcpdump -i eth0
    - Limit the capture to 100 packets:
      tcpdump -c 100
    - 
```
