## **Public key Cryptography** 

In Public key, two keys are used one key is used for encryption and another key is used for decryption. One key (public key) is used for encrypt the plain text to convert it into cipher text and another key (private key) is used by receiver to decrypt the cipher text to read the message.

   Public key encryption to encrypt the sender message starts with the receiver/
1. The receiver creates a pair of keys, a private and a public. The receiver keeps the private key and sends the public key to the sender.
2. The sender encrypts his message with the public key
3. When the receiver gets the message she decrypts it using the private key.
