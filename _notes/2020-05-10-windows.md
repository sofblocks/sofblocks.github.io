## How to use DIR command 
The command is used to list all files and subdirectories contained in a given directory.

    Volume in drive C is Windows 10
    Volume Serial Number is B009-E7A9

    Directory of C:\Users\IEUser\Desktop

    10/30/2019  11:50 AM    <DIR>          .
    10/30/2019  11:50 AM    <DIR>          ..

                G  Group directories first    -  Prefix to reverse order
```

## Dynamic Link Library (dll)

These are files in every application folder, which are used to store common pieces of `application logic` that can be accessed from multiple applications.
Since thereâ€™s no way to directly launch a DLL file, the rundll32.exe application is simply used to launch functionality stored in shared .dll files.

Note: the valid process is normally located at \Windows\System32\rundll32.exe, but sometimes spyware uses the same filename and runs from a different directory in order to disguise itself.

## Windows LFI

Windows Local Files Inclusion: is the process of including files, that are already locally present on the server, through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in an application.

This is mostly done through the utilisation of directory traversal ("../") to move up from the WebRoot directory to access local files.
In many different examples throughout the web you will see articles discussing LFI in regards to accessing files within Linux, such as accessing "/etc/passwd" or log files within "/var/log" or a user's Bash history "/home/[USERNAME]/.bash_history".
